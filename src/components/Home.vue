          <p>What are the most appreciated features of INNOVA Security brand cameras? ü§î<br>
            To begin with, the most appreciated aspect was QUALITY, everything INNOVA Security means was built on this
            principle.</p>

          <p> In addition to this basic criterion, cameras have implemented a lot of functionality, such as: <br>
            ‚úîÔ∏èMicrophone (allows users to capture sounds from the environment) <br>
            ‚úîÔ∏èSpeaker (allows users to communicate with personnel in the supervised area)<br>
            ‚úîÔ∏èColor (captures color images in low light or night often uses specific technologies to maintain color
            quality)<br>
            ‚úîÔ∏èLight (it has several functions by which, upon detection of movement, the camera light turns on or can be
            programmed)<br>
            ‚úîÔ∏èAI detection (detection of suspicious movements of people and cars in the surveillance area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe
            camera, the application will send a notification in this regard to always be informed and in control)<br>
            ‚úîÔ∏èData security (the protection of data stored and transmitted is done by adequate security to prevent
            unauthorized access)
          </p>
          <p>
            These are just some of the features that have made our security cameras appreciated by our customers ü§ó. We
            pride ourselves on providing innovative and reliable solutions for your safety &#10084;
